I am a Senior LLM Engineer at Joblogic, with expertise in AI, machine learning, and deep learning. I hold a BEng in Electronics – Telecommunications Engineering from Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology and am currently pursuing an MSc in Computer Science. My work focuses on large language models, computer vision, natural language processing, MLOps, and predictive analytics.

Before joining Joblogic, I served as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer and Data Science Team Leader at Nam A Bank, where I led projects applying AI to real-world financial challenges. Earlier in my career, I worked as an Algorithm Engineer at the LONG Centre for Educational Development. Beyond my technical roles, I also led the Bach Khoa Music Club, organizing flagship events such as BK’s Got Talent 2018.
