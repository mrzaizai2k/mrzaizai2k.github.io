The International Conference on Economics (ICE 2023), themed "Big Data, Digital Transformation in Economics, Finance, Banking, and Tourism," was held on March 18, 2023, at HUFI, Vietnam. It featured 109 presentations from 22 universities worldwide, focusing on topics like e-commerce, finance, banking, and digital transformation. 

As a Nam A Bank representative, my speech, "Big Data: The Fire of the 21st Century?", highlighted Big Data’s role in modern banking. I discussed its key characteristics—volume (massive datasets, e.g., 45 terabytes for ChatGPT), velocity (real-time processing), and variety (diverse, unstructured data). Applications included Obama’s campaign, Google Flu Trends, and customer retention in finance. I addressed challenges like data breaches and privacy, proposing solutions such as encryption and anonymization. Big Data’s transformative potential was likened to fire—powerful yet requiring careful handling.
